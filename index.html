    <h1>ARRAYS</h1>
    <h2>Odin-Project excersises</h2>
    <h3>What is an array?</h3>
        <pre>
            An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            /*This method is called "literal method"*/ 
            ***For simplicity, readability and execution speed, use the array literal method.

            this is another way to make arrays: "new array()"
            const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");

        </pre>
    
    <h3>What are arrays useful for?</h3>
        <pre>            
            What if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?
            
            The solution is an array!
            
            <strong>
            An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
            <strong>
            
            If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:
        
                let car1 = "Saab";
                let car2 = "Volvo";
                let car3 = "BMW";
        </pre>
    
    <h3>How do you access an array element?</h3>
        <pre>
            Accessing Array Elements
            You access an array element by referring to the index number: 
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            let car = cars[0];   //WILL PRINT Saab in screen

            Note: Array indexes start with 0.
            [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.
        </pre>

    <h3>How do you change an array element?</h3>    
        <pre>
            This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:

            cars[0] = "Opel";

            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
            cars[0] = "Opel";

            /*screen = Opel,Volvo,BMW*/ ~ Opel,Volvo,BMW
        </pre>

    <h3>What are some useful array properties?</h3>
        <pre>
            Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

            But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

            const person = ["John", "Doe", 46];

            Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". 
            In this example, person[0] returns John ,person[1] returns Doe, person[2] returns 46

            Objects use names to access its "members". In this example, person.firstName returns John:

            const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46};

            etc...

            Array Elements Can Be Objects
            JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

            Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

            You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:

            myArray[0] = Date.now;
            myArray[1] = myFunction;
            myArray[2] = myCars;
        </pre>

    <h3>What are some useful array methods?   The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods:</h3>
        <pre>
            yourArrayName.length   // Returns the number of elements
            yourArrayName.sort()   // Sorts the array

            The length Property
            Returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).
            * The length property is always one more than the highest array index.

            Example
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
            let length = fruits.length; ~ 4

            Accessing the FIRST Array Element
            Example:
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
            let fruit = fruits[0];   // AND SO ON [1] = Orange etc... 
            ~ Banana                    

            Accessing the LAST Array Element
            Example
            const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
            let fruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1]; //AND SO ON  -2 = Apple 
            ~ Mango
        </pre>

    <h3>What are loops useful for?</h3>
        <pre>
            Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, 
            from multiple basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to complete.
            Here we'll look at the loop structures available in JavaScript that handle such needs.
            
            We often need to repeat actions.

            For example, outputting goods from a list one after another or just running the same code for each number from 1 to 10.

            Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.
        </pre>

    <h1>When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects.
        JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
        You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
        You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.
    </h1>

    <h3>What is the break statement ?</h3>
        <pre>
            Normally, a loop exits when its condition becomes falsy.

            But we can force the exit at any time using the special break directive.

            For example, the loop below asks the user for a series of numbers, “breaking” when no number is entered:

                                        let sum = 0;

                                        while (true) {

                                        let value = +prompt("Enter a number", '');

                                        if (!value) break; // (*)

                                        sum += value;

                                        }
                                        alert( 'Sum: ' + sum );

            The break directive is activated at the line (*) if the user enters an empty line or cancels the input. It stops the loop immediately,
            passing control to the first line after the loop. Namely, alert.
            The combination “infinite loop + break as needed” is great for situations when a loop’s condition must be checked not in the beginning
            or end of the loop, but in the middle or even in several places of its body.
        </pre>

    <h3>What is the continue statement?</h3>
        <pre>
            The continue directive is a “lighter version” of break. It doesn’t stop the whole loop. Instead, it stops the current iteration and
             forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows).

            We can use it if we’re done with the current iteration and would like to move on to the next one.

            The loop below uses continue to output only odd values:

                                        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

                                        // if true, skip the remaining part of the body
                                        if (i % 2 == 0) continue;

                                        alert(i); // 1, then 3, 5, 7, 9
                                        }

            For even values of i, the continue directive stops executing the body and passes control to the next iteration of for (with the next number).
             So the alert is only called for odd values.

            The continue directive helps decrease nesting
            A loop that shows odd values could look like this:

                                        for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {

                                        if (i % 2) {
                                            alert( i );
                                            }

                                        }
            From a technical point of view, this is identical to the example above. Surely, we can just wrap the code in an if 
            block instead of using continue.

            But as a side effect, this created one more level of nesting (the alert call inside the curly braces).
            If the code inside of if is longer than a few lines, that may decrease the overall readability.
        </pre>

        <h2>Summary</h2>        
        <pre>
            
            3 types of loops:

            while – The condition is checked before each iteration.
            do..while – The condition is checked after each iteration.
            for (;;) – The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available.
            To make an “infinite” loop, usually the while(true) construct is used. Such a loop, just like any other, can be stopped with the break directive.

            If we don’t want to do anything in the current iteration and would like to forward to the next one, we can use the continue directive.

            break/continue support labels before the loop. A label is the only way for break/continue to escape a nested loop to go to an outer one.
        </pre>

    <h2>JS INFO EXCERSICES</h2>

    <pre>
        What is the last value alerted by this code? Why?

            let i = 3;

            while (i) {
            alert( i-- );
            }

        A = 1, because: 
             while i ! = 0 it´s true. otherwise if i = 0 it's false

             Every loop iteration decreases i by 1. The check while(i) stops the loop when i = 0.

             Hence, the steps of the loop form the following sequence (“loop unrolled”):
             
             let i = 3;
             
             alert(i--); // shows 3, decreases i to 2
             
             alert(i--) // shows 2, decreases i to 1
             
             alert(i--) // shows 1, decreases i to 0
             
             // done, while(i) check stops the loop

    </pre>
    <pre>
        Which values does the while loop show?
        importance: 4
        For every loop iteration, write down which value it outputs and then compare it with the solution.

        Both loops alert the same values, or not?

        The prefix form ++i:

        let i = 0;
        while (++i < 5) alert( i );

        The postfix form i++

        let i = 0;
        while (i++ < 5) alert( i );

        The task demonstrates how postfix/prefix forms can lead to different results when used in comparisons.

        From 1 to 4

        let i = 0;
        while (++i < 5) alert( i );
        The first value is i = 1, because ++i first increments i and then returns the new value. So the first comparison is 1 < 5 and the alert shows 1.

        Then follow 2, 3, 4… – the values show up one after another. The comparison always uses the incremented value, because ++ is before the variable.

        Finally, i = 4 is incremented to 5, the comparison while(5 < 5) fails, and the loop stops. So 5 is not shown.

        From 1 to 5

        let i = 0;
        while (i++ < 5) alert( i );
        The first value is again i = 1. The postfix form of i++ increments i and then returns the old value, so the comparison i++ < 5 will use i = 0 (contrary to ++i < 5).

        But the alert call is separate. It’s another statement which executes after the increment and the comparison. So it gets the current i = 1.

        Then follow 2, 3, 4…

        Let’s stop on i = 4. The prefix form ++i would increment it and use 5 in the comparison. But here we have the postfix form i++. So it increments i to 5, but returns the old value. Hence the comparison is actually while(4 < 5) – true, and the control goes on to alert.

        The value i = 5 is the last one, because on the next step while(5 < 5) is false.
    </pre> 
    <pre>
        Which values get shown by the "for" loop?
        importance: 4
        For each loop write down which values it is going to show. Then compare with the answer.

        Both loops alert same values or not?

        The postfix form:

        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
        The prefix form:

        for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );

            The answer: from 0 to 4 in both cases.

            for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );
            
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );
            That can be easily deducted from the algorithm of for:
            
            Execute once i = 0 before everything (begin).
            Check the condition i < 5
            If true – execute the loop body alert(i), and then i++
            The increment i++ is separated from the condition check (2). That’s just another statement.
            
            The value returned by the increment is not used here, so there’s no difference between i++ and ++i.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Output even numbers in the loop
        importance: 5
        Use the for loop to output even numbers from 2 to 10.

        for (let i = 2; i <= 10; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
              alert( i );
            }
          }

        We use the “modulo” operator % to get the remainder and check for the evenness here.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Replace "for" with "while"
            importance: 5
            Rewrite the code changing the for loop to while without altering its behavior (the output should stay same).

            for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            alert( `number ${i}!` );
            }

            solution

            let i = 0;
            while (i < 3) {
            alert( `number ${i}!` );
            i++;
            }
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Repeat until the input is correct
        importance: 5
        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.

        The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.

        Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this task.

        solution

        let num;

                do {
                num = prompt("Enter a number greater than 100?", 0);
                } while (num <= 100 && num);

                
                The loop do..while repeats while both checks are truthy:

                The check for num <= 100 – that is, the entered value is still not greater than 100.
                The check && num is false when num is null or an empty string. Then the while loop stops too.
                P.S. If num is null then num <= 100 is true, so without the 2nd check the loop wouldn’t stop if the user clicks CANCEL. Both checks are required.
    </pre>
    <pre>
        Output prime numbers
        importance: 3
        An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything except 1 and itself.

        In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it can’t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n.

        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4.

        Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n.

        For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7.

        P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value.

        solution

        There are many algorithms for this task.

        Let’s use a nested loop:

        For each i in the interval {
        check if i has a divisor from 1..i
        if yes => the value is not a prime
        if no => the value is a prime, show it
        }
        The code using a label:

        let n = 10;

        nextPrime:
        for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) { // for each i...

        for (let j = 2; j < i; j++) { // look for a divisor..
            if (i % j == 0) continue nextPrime; // not a prime, go next i
        }

        alert( i ); // a prime
        }
        There’s a lot of space to optimize it. For instance, we could look for the divisors from 2 to square root of i. But anyway,
        if we want to be really efficient for large intervals, we need to change the approach and rely on advanced maths and complex
        algorithms like Quadratic sieve, General number field sieve etc.
